1. Dam of Candies 
Medium Accuracy: 100.0% Submissions: 1210 Points: 4
Geek wants to make a special space for candies on his bookshelf. Currently, it has N books of different heights and unit width. Help him select 2 books such that he can store maximum candies between them by removing all the other books from between the selected books. The task is to find out the area between 2 books that can hold the maximum candies without changing the original position of selected books. 

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, height[] = {1, 3, 4}
Output: 1
Explanation:
1. Area between book of height 1 and book of 
height 3 is 0 as there is no space between 
them.
2. Area between book of height 1 and book of 
height 4 is 1 by removing book of height 3.
3. Area between book of height 3 and book of 
height 4 is 0 as there is no space between them.

Example 2:

Input: N = 6, height[] = {2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5}
Output: 8
Explanation: We remove the 4 books in the middle 
creating length = 4 for the candy dam. Height 
for dam will be min(2,5) = 2. Area between book 
of height 2 and book of height 5 is 2 x 4 = 8.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function maxCandy() which takes the array height[] and size of array N as input parameters and returns the maximum candies geek can store

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
